# Contact Form Recurring Issue - PERMANENT FIX

## Problem Identified

The contact form was failing repeatedly because of **conflicting frontend setups**:

1. **Next.js application** (pages/contact.js) - The actual contact form
2. **Static HTML frontend** (frontend/ directory) - Legacy simple HTML version

The startup scripts were incorrectly starting the static HTML version instead of the Next.js application, causing the contact form API calls to fail.

## Root Cause

- `start-frontend.sh` was starting a Python HTTP server from `frontend/` directory
- The actual contact form is in the Next.js app (`pages/contact.js`)
- This mismatch caused the form to try calling the backend API but from the wrong frontend context

## Permanent Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Startup Scripts

**Updated `start-frontend.sh`:**
- Now starts Next.js development server (`npm run dev`)
- Includes proper dependency checks and installation
- Serves the correct frontend with the contact form

**Created `start-production.sh`:**
- Robust startup script with proper error handling
- Starts both servers with cleanup on exit
- Better process management

### 2. Verified Configuration

✅ **Backend Configuration:**
- FastAPI server running on port 8000
- CORS properly configured for frontend requests
- Contact form endpoint `/api/contact` working correctly

✅ **Frontend Configuration:**
- Next.js server running on port 3000
- Environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000` set correctly
- Contact form properly configured to call backend API

✅ **Form Submission Flow:**
1. User fills out form on `/contact` page
2. Form data sent to `http://localhost:8000/api/contact`
3. Backend processes and logs submission
4. Success response returned to user

## How to Start Servers (CORRECT WAY)

### Option 1: Use the Fixed Production Script
```bash
./start-production.sh
```

### Option 2: Start Individually
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python run.py

# Terminal 2 - Frontend (from project root)
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Use the Fixed Individual Scripts
```bash
# Terminal 1
./start-backend.sh

# Terminal 2  
./start-frontend.sh
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check servers are running:**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :8000  # Backend
   lsof -i :3000  # Frontend
   ```

2. **Test backend API:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/
   ```

3. **Test contact form:**
   - Visit http://localhost:3000/contact
   - Fill out the form
   - Should see success message: "Thank you for your inquiry! We'll respond within 24-48 hours."

## Monitoring

Form submissions are logged to:
- `backend/contact_submissions.json` - Structured data
- `backend/email_notifications.txt` - Email format

## Troubleshooting

If the form still fails:

1. **Check both servers are running** on correct ports
2. **Verify environment variables** in `.env.local`
3. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
4. **Restart both servers** using the corrected scripts

## Prevention

- Always use the corrected startup scripts
- Don't manually start servers with different commands
- The `start-production.sh` script includes proper cleanup and error handling
- Monitor the logs for any backend errors

---

**Status: ✅ PERMANENTLY FIXED**

The recurring contact form issue has been resolved by fixing the frontend startup configuration and ensuring the correct Next.js application is served instead of the legacy static HTML version.
